# Non steam game sync

If you are like me install several games on sdcard, and add launcher on steam as non-game, so you already notice when you remove the sdcard, the game remains there as ghost from the past. If you have several sdcards, this is even worst, the confusion between what game is in what card.

when you install this app, the steam deck shortcuts are hidden for the games that points to exe that is on a removed sdcard, and re-appers when you add the sdcard. 

No support to shortcuts created by lutris or bottler.
